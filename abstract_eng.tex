Nowadays an electric grid is an important part of our society. It consists of power plants, power lines and substations. With these components electricity can be delivered from power plants to the end users. Substations and their automation play an important role in guaranteeing power grid safety and functionality. The focus of this master thesis is to plan and implement a software component to be a part of the bigger system which is related to substations and their management. The implemented component should be able to subscribe information from the substation and share that with other parts of the system. The information from the substation can include different types of data such as measurement data which for example can be shown on the user interface.

The information is subscribed in substations from an \emph{Intelligent Electronic Device}, \emph{IED} for short. An IED is an automation device which controls the other physical devices of the substation. IEDs are also connected to the substation's local network. IED can also be called with the name protection relay. The \emph{International Electrotechnical Commission} has defined a worldwide standard called \emph{IEC 61850} which defines the rules how IED devices should communicate with each other over the substation network. This standard also defines rules for how a software outside the substation network can subscribe information from the IED.

Before this thesis started, a proof of concept software component had already been developed. However, this component had many problems and so it was not used as a part of the system in production. Analyzing these problems was a part of this thesis. The new knowledge was then used to plan an improved version of the software component.

As a result from this thesis was a software component independent from other parts of the system. Implemented component was also able to subscribe information from the IED according to the IEC 61850 standard and share it with the other parts of the system. The component ended up being a part of the bigger system in the production environment.
